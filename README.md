# Pdnode Website
This is the new official website and its front-end and back-end.

## What's the difference between it and [www.pdnode.com](https://github.com/pdnode-team/www.pdnode.com)?
[www.pdnode.com](https://github.com/pdnode-team/www.pdnode.com) is the original website. The new generation website has more features and includes a backend, but it is not ready for production.

## When will it be reached?
Website development has the following stages:
- We are currently in this stage. -> `dev` - Development
- `alpha` - Preliminary internal testing
- `beta` - Public Test
- `rc` - Pre-release
- `none` - No pre-release tag = Official version

## Important Information
- This project is not yet open source, but it will be in the future.
- **Don't trust the "latest" tag**!
- - The version provided by `latest` is inaccurate or may be older. Please use a specific version number.
- - When we release the official version, you can use it with confidence.
