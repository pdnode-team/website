# Pdnode Website
This is the new official website and its front-end and back-end.

## What's the difference between it and [www.pdnode.com](https://github.com/pdnode-team/www.pdnode.com)?
[www.pdnode.com](https://github.com/pdnode-team/www.pdnode.com) is the original website. The new generation website has more features and includes a backend, but it is not ready for production.

- `alpha` - Preliminary internal testing
- `beta` - Public Test
- `rc` - Pre-release
- `none` - No pre-release tag = Official version
